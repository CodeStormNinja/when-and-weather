# When & Weather üå¶Ô∏è

A web system designed to facilitate the access to weather forecasting regardless of the location or specific period needed. Made for our project the [2025 NASA Space Apps Hackathon Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/).

The project is divided in 3 parts:
- The **front-end layer**, with an app developed with React to display the UI for users.
- The **back-end domain layer**, with an API that deals with the business logic and decision-making to give a cleaner and more purposeful description for the users, developed with Java.
- The **data layer**, with an API that translates the location query into specific coordinates (globally) and checks the weather for that location and date/time inputs, developed with Python.

## Features

### Web application

### Domain API
- **RESTful Endpoint**: Available at `/api/clima/analise` for GET requests.
- **Enhanced Classification Logic**: The climate service determines the thermal comfort based on temperature and appends a rain forecast based on humidity.

### Data API
- **Weather Forecast API**: Provides weather forecast data via `/api/v1/weather-forecast`.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
- **External Integrations**: Connects to external APIs (e.g., Open-Meteo) using reusable HTTP context classes.
- **Swagger Documentation**: API models and documentation available for easy integration and testing, accessible through the root endpoint `/`.

## Requirements

### Data API
- **Python 3.12**

### Domain API
- **Java JDK 21+**
- **Apache Maven (Wrapper included)**

## How to Run

### Data API
1. **Set up a Python 3.12 environment**  
   (e.g., using `venv` or `conda`)

   ```sh
   python3.12 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`**  
   (using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) if you use a lock file)

   ```sh
   pip install -e .
   # or, if using poetry:
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Run the application**  
   ```sh
   python -m main.app
   ```

### Domain API
Prerequisites: Ensure Java 21 or higher is installed and configured.

Start the Application: Use the Maven Wrapper (mvnw) to run the Spring Boot application:

- **For Linux/macOS**
```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- **For Windows**
```sh
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Access: The API will be running at http://localhost:8080.
